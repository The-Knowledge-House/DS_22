# programming-lab

## Objective
This lab aims to reinforce your skills in basic Python programming. By the end of this exercise, you will be able to: 
1. Force and interpret errors in Python.
2. Understand and explain types in Python.
3. Implement basic arithmetic in Python.
4. Recognize floating point error in Python.

## Prerequisites
* VSCode. If you have not installed VSCode yet, click [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and select your operating system (OS).

## Part 1: ex11.py

Access the file labeled `ex11.py` and implement the commented directions and describe what the effects are in your own words. For example, question 1 asks "In a print statement, what happens if you leave out one of the parentheses or both?" To test this out, you would run a line of code similar to:

```python
print "hello world"
```

observe the output message in your terminal and write up the effects you saw as a comment. For example:

```python
# After running print "hello world" I saw XYZ
```

Afterward, you will delete or correct the erroneous line of code to continue with your exercise.

```python
print("hello world")
```

## Part 2: ex12.py

Access the file `ex12.py` and implement the commented directions as code. For example, question 1 asks "How many seconds are there in 42 minutes 42 seconds?" You would create a Python name and assign it to the equation that will correctly answer this question. For example:

```python
ans = ...
print(ans)
```

## Bonus Challenge

Access the file `bonus.py` and create a script that implements the functionality described in the comments. This part of the lab is optional and purely designed for challenge. Be sure to struggle with a question for 15 minutes before reaching out to a human or a language model. 

## Submission

This exercise will **not** be submitted for grading.
