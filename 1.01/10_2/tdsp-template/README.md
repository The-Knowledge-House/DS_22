# TDSP Project Structure, and Documents and Artifact Templates

This is a general project directory structure for Team Data Science Process developed by Microsoft. It also contains templates for various documents that are recommended as part of executing a data science project when using TDSP. 

[Team Data Science Process (TDSP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview) is an agile, iterative, data science methodology to improve collaboration and team learning. It is supported through a lifecycle definition, standard project structure, artifact templates, and [tools](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-TDSP-Utilities) for productive data science. 


**NOTE:** In this directory structure, the **Sample_Data folder is NOT supposed to contain LARGE raw or processed data**. It is only supposed to contain **small and sample** data sets, which could be used to test the code.

**NOTE:** In some projects, e.g. short term proof of principle (PoC) or proof of value (PoV) engagements, it can be relatively time consuming to create and all the recommended documents and artifacts. In that case, at least the Charter and Exit Report should be created and delivered to the customer or client. As necessary, organizations may modify certain sections of the documents. But it is strongly recommended that the content of the documents be maintained, as they provide important information about the project and deliverables.

## What is Markdown?

You'll notice that all of our text files contain the extension (end of file) `.md`. This is the file extension that signifies that a file is in "markdown" format? 

What exactly is markdown? Think of a text file that supports formatting using simple and memorable symbols. If you've ever left a comment on reddit, you should be familair with this syntax! 

# We can make large headers!
## Smaller sub-headers
### And so on!

We can also implement [hyperlinks](https://www.google.com/).

And even images!
