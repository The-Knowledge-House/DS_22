# ^^^ everytime we want to "include" a package in Python, we must
# use the "import" statement

# sometimes we need other functions from various packages
# for example, the 'maths' package
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html

# why try to make something new when some nerd made this for us already?
# jk, we are the nerds in this case
