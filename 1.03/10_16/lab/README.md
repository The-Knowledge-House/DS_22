# function-lab

Reminder: when opening this file, hit "ctrl + shift + v" or "cmd + shift + v" to make it pretty.

## Objective
This lab aims to reinforce your skills in basic function definitions. By the end of this exercise, you will be able to: 
1. Debug basic functions
2. Implement functions that take in arguments & return values
3. Take functions that interpret data-structures

## Prerequisites
* VSCode. If you have not installed VSCode yet, click [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and select your operating system (OS).
* Undersand basic Python assignment
* Understand for-loops and datastructures
* Understand conditionals

## Part 1: ex31.py

Access the file labeled `ex31.py` and implement the commented directions.

For each part, you will be completing, creating, or debugging a function. After defining the function, you will then call this function using the provided variables.

## Part 2: ex32.py

Access the file labeled `ex33.py` and implement the commented directions.

For each part, you will be creating a function. After defining the function, you will then call this function using the provided variables.

## Bonus Challenge

Access the file `bonus.py` and create a function that accomplishes the same functionality as the code in `bad_code.py`.

Generally, we want to use functions to "encapsulate" logic. This helps us with debugging, and makes code maintainable.
