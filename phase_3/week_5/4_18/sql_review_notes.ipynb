    "One (or more) attribute(s) uniquely determines another (group of ) attribute(s).\n",
    "R is a relation with attributes X & Y. We state there is a functional dependency b/w X & Y (X -> Y) if each value of  X is associated with precisely one Y value. In this case, X is the determinant  and Y is the dependent attribute.\n",

    "Given the value of X we can determine information in the rest of the row, but not vice-versa.\n",
