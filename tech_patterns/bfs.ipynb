    "A tree is an object composed of nodes & connections. We start from a root-tree and then generate branches that lead to children. Abstractly, think of this as a family-tree, where the great-grandparents are at the top, the grandparents are a level below, the parents are at the 3rd level, and then finally the bottom-most nodes constitute the children.\n",

    "One type of tree that we will discuss today is a binary tree. This is a tree that strictly has two or less (hence the binary) children for every parent node.\n",

    "A fundemental part of this algorithm is the [queue](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-data-structure/). If your first exposure to the English language was British English (as opposed to American English), you'll recognize this word as simply meaning \"line.\" That is, the first element in is the first element out (FIFO). \n",

    "Thankfully, the algorithm for BFS will simply be the same thing as DFS, but just with the `queue` data-structure. Now, bfs and dfs are fundementally used for different use-cases. However, notice that they are essentially the **same** algorithm with simply one data-structure swapped out! This proves that data-structures are just as important as algorithms when it comes to engineering.\n",
